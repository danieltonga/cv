  <p>
    I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science of Econcomics from the University of Utah in May 2019. I have a backround in financial services.
    <br> I began my career in finance working for a private wealth management firm (Wells Fargo Advisors) as a client associate.
    <br> I then joined a fintech startup called Carta, where I currently work as a financial analyst performing valuations for venture-backed startups
    <br /> across a number of different industries: SaaS, fintech, biotech, cybersecurity, AI/ML, consumer retail, blockchain, IoT, healthcare, etc.
    <br><br> I am an aspiring tech entrepreneur and am taking up web development as a hobby!
